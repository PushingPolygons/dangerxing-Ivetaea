# This script should include - 

# 1: When spawning - activate four hit detection zones in the doorways.
# If the detection zone finds an adjacent room, remove Door Blocker object in 
# that cardinal direction.

# 2: Spawn creatures - Spawn creatures at creature spawn points
# (OPTIONAL) - randomize which creature spawns at each point

# 3: Spawn Gems/Chest - Spawn a gem at each gem location, spawn the room's chest.
# (OPTIONAL) - randomize gem locations, but ensure that at least a minimum
# number of gems spawn. Only 1 chest per room.




# Declare member variables here. Examples:
# var a = 2
# var b = "text"
